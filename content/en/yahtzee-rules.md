Contents: 5 dice, dice cup, 10 bonus chips, score pad

### Object

Roll dice for scoring combinations, and get the highest total score.

### Game Summary

On each turn, roll the dice up to 3 times to get the highest scoring combination for one of 13 categories. After you finish rolling, you must place a score or a zero in one of the 13 category boxes on your scorecard. The game ends when all players have filled in their 13 boxes. Scores are totaled, including any bonus points. The player with the highest total wins.

### How to Play

Each player takes a score card. To decide who goes first, each player in turn rolls all 5 dice. The player with the highest total goes first. Play then passes to the left.

### Taking a Turn

On your turn, you may roll the dice up to 3 times, although you may stop and score after your first or second roll. To roll the dice, place them in the dice cup, shake them up, and roll them out.

- **First roll:** Roll all 5 dice. Set any “keepers” aside. You may stop and score now, or roll again.
- **Second roll:** Reroll ANY or ALL dice you want—even ”keepers” from the previous roll. You don’t need to declare which combination you’re rolling for; you may change your mind after any roll.
- **Third and final roll:** Reroll ANY or ALL dice you want. After your third roll, you must fill in a box on your scorecard with a score or a zero. After you fill in a box, your turn is over.

### Scoring

When you are finished rolling, decide which box to fill in on your scorecard. For each game, there is a column of 13 boxes. You must fill in a box on each turn; if you can’t (or don’t want to) enter a score, you must enter a zero. Fill in each box only once, in any order, depending on your best scoring option. The scorecard is divided into an Upper Section and a Lower Section. Scoring combinations for each section are explained below.

| Upper Section | What to Score |
| --- | --- |
| Aces (Ones) | Total of Aces only |
| Twos | Total of Twos only |
| Threes | Total of Threes only |
| Fours | Total of Fours only |
| Fives | Total of Fives only |
| Sixes | Total of Sixes only |

To score in the Upper Section, add only the dice with the same number and enter the total in the appropriate box. For example, with the dice shown below, you could score 9 in the Threes box, 2 in the Twos box, or 4 in the Fours box.

\| ⚂ ⚂ ⚂ ⚁ ⚃ \|

Your goal in the Upper Section is to score a total of at least 63 points, to earn a 35-point bonus. The bonus points are based on scoring three of each number (Aces through Sixes); however, you may earn the bonus with any combination of scores totaling 63 points or more.

Each of the Lower Section scoring combinations is explained in detail in the next column.

| Lower Section | What to Score |
| --- | --- |
| 3 of a Kind | Total of all 5 dice |
| 4 of a Kind | Total of all 5 dice |
| Full House | 25 points |
| Small Straight | 30 points |
| Large Straight | 40 points |
| Chance | Total of all 5 dice |

**3 of a Kind:** Score in this box only if the dice include 3 or more of the same number. For example, with the dice shown below you could score 18 points in the 3 of a Kind box.

\| ⚄ ⚄ ⚄ ⚁ ⚀ \|

_Other Scoring Options:_ You could instead score 18 in the Chance box, or you could score in the Upper Section: 15 in the Fives box, 2 in the Twos box, or 1 in the Aces box.

**4 of a Kind:** Score in this box only if the dice include 4 or more of the same number. For example, with the dice shown below you could score 14 points in the 4 of a Kind box.

\| ⚁ ⚁ ⚁ ⚁ ⚅ \|

_Other Scoring Options:_ You could instead score 14 in the 3 of a Kind box or in the Chance box—or you could score in the Upper Section: 8 in the Twos box, or 6 in the Sixes box.

**Full House:** Score in this box only if the dice show three of one number and two of another. Any Full House is worth 25 points. For example, with the dice shown below you could score 25 points in the Full House box.

\| ⚂ ⚂ ⚂ ⚄ ⚄ \|

_Other Scoring Options:_ You could instead score 19 in the 3 of a kind box or in the Chance box – or you could score in the Upper Section: 9 in the Threes box or 10 in the Fives box.

**Small Straight:** Score in this box only if the dice show any sequence of four numbers. Any Small Straight is worth 30 points. You could score 30 points in the Small Straight box with any of the three dice combinations shown below.

\| ⚀ ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ \+ any dice \|

\| ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ \+ any dice \|

\| ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅ \+ any dice \|

_Other Scoring Options_: You could instead score in the Chance box, or in the appropriate Upper Section box.

**Large Straight:** Score in this box only if the dice show any sequence of five numbers. Any Large Straight is worth 40 points. You could score 40 points in the Large Straight box with either of the two dice combinations shown below.

\| ⚀ ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ \|

\| ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅ \|

_Other Scoring Options:_ You could instead score in the Small Straight box, the Chance box, or the appropriate Upper Section box.

**YAHTZEE:** Score in this box only if the dice show five of the same number (5 of a kind). A YAHTZEE example is shown below.

\| ⚀ ⚀ ⚀ ⚀ ⚀ \|

The first YAHTZEE you enter in the YAHTZEE box is worth 50 points. For each additional YAHTZEE you roll, you earn a bonus (see YAHTZEE BONUS, below)!

**Chance:** Score the total of any 5 dice in this box. This catch-all category comes in handy when you can’t (or don’t want to) score in another category, and don’t want to enter a zero.

For example, you could score 22 points in the Chance box with the dice shown below.

\| ⚀ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅ ⚅ \|

**YAHTZEE BONUS:** If you roll a YAHTZEE and have already filled in the YAHTZEE box with a 50, you get a 100-point bonus! Take one bonus chip, then place a checkmark (✓) in the YAHTZEE BONUS box on your scorecard. Then fill in one of the 13 boxes on your scorecard according to the JOKER RULES, described below.

As long as you’ve scored 50 in the YAHTZEE box, you get a YAHTZEE bonus for each additional YAHTZEE you roll—just squeeze in the check marks if necessary!

If you roll a YAHTZEE and have already entered zero in the YAHTZEE box, you do not earn a YAHTZEE bonus; however, you must fill in one of the 13 boxes on your scorecard according to the JOKER RULES below.

**JOKER RULES:** Score the total of all 5 dice in the appropriate Upper Section box. If this box has already been filled in, score as follows in any open Lower Section box:

| Lower Section | Points |
| --- | --- |
| 3 of a Kind | Total of all 5 dice |
| 4 of a Kind | Total of all 5 dice |
| Full House | 25 points |
| Small Straight | 30 points |
| Large Straight | 40 points |
| Chance | Total of all 5 dice |

If the appropriate Upper Section box and all Lower Section boxes are filled in, you must enter a zero in any open Upper Section box.

For example, you roll 5 Fours. You’ve already entered zero in the YAHTZEE box, and have also scored in the Fours box in the Upper Section. The Joker rules allow you to score in any open box in the Lower Section. You decide to score 40 points in the Large Straight box.

### Ending a Game

Once each player has filled in all 13 category boxes, the game ends. Each player now adds up his or her score as follows:

**Upper Section:** Add up the Upper Section scores and enter the total in the TOTAL SCORE box. Enter the 35-point bonus in the BONUS box if you scored 63 points or more. Then enter the total in the TOTAL box.

**Lower Section:** Add up the Lower Section scores, and enter the total in the **TOTAL of Lower Section** box. Add 100 points for each checkmark in the **YAHTZEE BONUS** boxes (that is, one checkmark for each bonus chip).

**Grand Total:** Add the Upper Section and Lower Section scores, and enter the total in this box. This is your score for the game.

### How to Win

After the scores are tallied, the player with the highest Grand Total wins the game!

### Solo Play

No competition around? Challenge yourself in solitaire play, and try to beat your previous scores!

### A Turn Example

You’re well into a 4-player game. Your dice rolls and scoring strategy are illustrated below.

#### **First Roll**

\| ⚁ ⚃ ⚄ ⚃ ⚁ \|

You could roll again for **Fours**, **3 of a Kind**, or **Large Straight**. You’ve already scored your **Small Straight**, so it’s risky; but the **2/3/4/5** gives you a good chance of rolling either an Ace or a Six in the next two rolls. You decide to set aside the **Small Straight** and reroll one die.

* * *

#### **Second Roll**

\| ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚁ \|

You roll a **Two**. You could reroll the die again for your **Large Straight**, or set aside the 2 Twos and roll for your **Twos** or for **3 of a Kind**. You decide to set aside the twos and reroll the remaining 3 dice.

* * *

#### **Third and Final Roll**

\| ⚁ ⚁ ⚂ ⚁ ⚂ \|

You roll 1 **Two** and 2 **Threes**. You could score 6 points for **Twos**, 12 points for **3 of a Kind**, or 25 points for **Full House**. You decide on the **Full House** because this combination can be tough to roll later in the game; also, you’re ahead in the **Upper Section**, so you may not need 3 Twos for your 35-point bonus; and also, you’re hoping that later you’ll roll a higher-scoring **3 of a Kind**!

**Upper Section**

| Upper Section | How to Score | Game #1 | Game #2 | Game #3 | Game #4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Aces (⚀ = 1) | Count and Add Only Aces | 3 |  |  |  |
| Twos (⚁ = 2) | Count and Add Only Twos |  |  |  |  |
| Threes (⚂ = 3) | Count and Add Only Threes |  |  |  |  |
| Fours (⚃ = 4) | Count and Add Only Fours |  |  |  |  |
| Fives (⚄ = 5) | Count and Add Only Fives | 15 |  |  |  |
| Sixes (⚅ = 6) | Count and Add Only Sixes | 24 |  |  |  |

**Total Score →**

**Bonus** (If total score is 63 or over): **Score 35**

**Total of Upper Section →**

* * *

**Lower Section**

| Lower Section | How to Score | Game #1 | Game #2 | Game #3 | Game #4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 of a Kind | Add Total of All Dice |  |  |  |  |
| 4 of a Kind | Add Total of All Dice | 18 |  |  |  |
| Full House | Score 25 |  |  |  |  |
| Small Straight | Sequence of 4 | 30 |  |  |  |
| Large Straight | Sequence of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| Yahtzee | 5 of a Kind (Score 50) |  |  |  |  |
| Chance | Score Total of All 5 Dice |  |  |  |  |
| Yahtzee Bonus | 3 For Each Bonus (Score 100) |  |  |  |  |

## How to Play Yahtzee

In this guide, we break down the game step by step, showing you how to set up, roll the dice, and choose the best scoring categories. Follow our detailed instructions and you’ll be ready to play your best game of Yahtzee in no time!

## How to Play Yahtzee: A Step-by-Step Guide

![Yahtzee rules guide](/images/Yahtzee-rules-guide.webp)

Yahtzee is a fun and strategic dice game enjoyed by millions. Whether you’re new to the game or need a refresher, this step-by-step guide will teach you everything you need to know about playing Yahtzee. Get ready to roll the dice, make the right choices, and score big!

**Total tid:** 15 minuter

### **Step 1: Game Setup**

![Game Setup](/images/Game-Setup.webp)

Before the fun begins, make sure everyone is set up for the game:

**Players:** Yahtzee can be played by 2 or more players. If you’re playing solo, the goal is to beat your own score.

**Equipment:** You’ll need:

– Five dice

– A scorecard for each player (downloadable or paper versions work)

– A pen or pencil to mark scores

– A dice cup (optional, but adds to the fun!)

Each player receives a scorecard, and you’re ready to start rolling!

### **Step 2: Rolling the Dice**

![Rolling the Dice](/images/Rolling-the-Dice.webp)

On each turn, players roll the dice up to three times to get the best possible combination. Here’s how it works:

1\. First Roll: Roll all five dice.

2\. Reroll: After the first roll, you can choose to reroll any or all of the dice up to two more times. Keep the dice you like and reroll the others to improve your chances.

3\. Final Roll: After the third roll, or if you’re satisfied earlier, you must use the current dice combination to fill in a category on your scorecard.

Example:On your first roll, you get two 6s, one 3, one 1, and one 4. You decide to keep the 6s and reroll the other three dice to try and get a Three of a Kind or better.

### **Step 3: Choosing a Score Category**

![Choosing a Score Category](/images/Choosing-a-Score-Category.webp)

Each turn, you must choose a category from the scorecard to record your score. Each category can only be used once, so choose wisely! Here’s a quick overview of the main categories:

Upper Section:

– Ones to Sixes: Simply total the number of that specific dice face. For example, if you roll three 5s, you score 15 in the ”Fives” category.

– Bonus: If the total of your upper section is 63 or more, you earn a 35-point bonus.

Lower Section:

– Three of a Kind: Score the total of all dice if you roll at least three of the same number.

– Four of a Kind: Score the total of all dice if you roll four of the same number.

– Full House: Score 25 points for a roll of three of one number and two of another (e.g., three 4s and two 5s).

– Small Straight: Score 30 points for a sequence of four consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-2-3-4 or 2-3-4-5).

– Large Straight: Score 40 points for a sequence of five consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-2-3-4-5 or 2-3-4-5-6).

– Yahtzee: Score 50 points for rolling five of the same number.

– Chance: Score the total of any combination of dice.

Once you choose a category, write down the score, and that category is locked for the rest of the game.

Example:You roll two 4s, two 3s, and one 5. This is a perfect opportunity to claim the Full House category, giving you 25 points.

### **Step 4: Scoring**

![scoring yahtzee](/images/scoring-yahtzee.webp)

At the end of each turn, you must enter your score into one of the categories on the scorecard. Here’s how to score:

– Upper Section Strategy: Focus on filling in your upper section early to aim for the 35-point bonus. To achieve this, you’ll need an average of three of each number (i.e., three 1s, three 2s, etc.).

– Lower Section Strategy: Save high-risk categories like Yahtzee and Large Straight for later, unless you roll one early in the game.

### **Step 5: Ending the Game**

![ending the game](/images/ending-the-game.webp)

The game ends after all players have filled in their entire scorecard, which happens after thirteen rounds. Here’s how to finish:

– Calculate Total Scores: Add up the total from both the Upper Section and the Lower Section.

– Upper Section Bonus: If the total in the upper section is 63 or higher, don’t forget to add the 35-point bonus.

– Yahtzee Bonus: If you rolled more than one Yahtzee during the game, you get an additional 100 points for each Yahtzee after the first.

The player with the highest score wins!

## 5 Tips for Rerolling and Strategy

To maximize your score, you need more than luck. Follow these tips for smart rerolling decisions:

#### **Tip 1: Prioritize the Upper Section Early**

In the early rounds, aim to fill in your **Upper Section**. Scoring an average of three of each number ensures you get the 35-point bonus. This can make a significant difference in your total score.

#### **Tip 2: Strategic Rerolling for Lower Section**

- **Three of a Kind:** If you already have three of the same number, reroll the other two dice to try and achieve a higher total.
- **Full House:** If you roll two of one number and three of another, don’t hesitate to lock in the **Full House** score of 25 points.
- **Small and Large Straights:** If you roll two or three numbers in sequence (e.g., 2-3-4), hold them and reroll the other dice to try for a straight.

#### **Tip 3: Take Risks with Yahtzee**

If you’ve already filled in the **Yahtzee** category and you roll another Yahtzee, you can score **100 bonus points** for each additional Yahtzee! To maximize your chances:

- Keep four of a kind if you’re close to a Yahtzee, and reroll the fifth die.
- If you’re behind in points, sometimes it’s worth taking the risk and rerolling for a Yahtzee or **Four of a Kind**.

#### **Tip 4: Don’t Be Afraid to Use the Chance Category**

If your rolls don’t match any of the categories, use the **Chance** category. It’s better to score something rather than nothing! The **Chance** allows you to total any combination of dice and enter it as your score.

## Yahtzee FAQ

If you’re new to Yahtzee or want to clarify some of the game’s rules, this FAQ section will answer the most common questions about how to play, scoring, and strategy. Let’s dive into everything you need to know to become a Yahtzee master!

### Common Questions Answered

### **What is a Yahtzee bonus?**

When you score your first Yahtzee (five of the same number), you earn 50 points. After that, each additional Yahtzee in the same game earns you a 100-point bonus! However, to get the bonus, you must have already filled in the Yahtzee category with 50 points on your scorecard. If the Yahtzee category is filled with a zero, you won’t be able to claim the bonus.

### Can Yahtzee be played solo?

Yes, Yahtzee is a great game to play solo! The objective is to beat your own high score over multiple games. Playing solo can also help you practice your strategy and get better at making reroll decisions. Simply follow the standard rules, track your score, and aim to improve with each game!

### How do you break a tie in Yahtzee?

If two or more players end the game with the same total score, there are a few common ways to break a tie:

**Upper Section Score:** The player with the higher score in the upper section (Ones through Sixes) wins.

**Yahtzee Bonuses:** If tied players have scored multiple Yahtzees, the one with the most Yahtzee bonuses wins.

**Custom Tie-Breaker Rules:** Some players agree on a rematch or a specific roll-off to settle the tie.

### What is the difference between Yahtzee and Yatzy?

While similar, **Yahtzee** and **Yatzy** have a few key differences:

**Scoring:** In Yahtzee, a **Full House** is always worth 25 points, while in Yatzy, the sum of the dice must equal 18 for it to count as a Full House.

**Reroll Rules:** In Yahtzee, after scoring a Yahtzee, you don’t get to reroll the dice unless you’ve filled the Yahtzee category.

**Bonuses:** Yahtzee includes a bonus for additional Yahtzees, while Yatzy has different bonus structures.

### **What happens if you can’t score in any category?**

If none of your dice combinations match the remaining categories on your scorecard, you must enter a zero in one of the categories. Choose wisely—try to zero out a category that you think will be hard to score later, like Yahtzee or Large Straight.

### What is the best strategy for winning Yahtzee?

The key to winning Yahtzee is balancing risk and reward. Some strategies include:

**Maximize the Upper Section Bonus:** Focus on filling in the upper section early to score at least 63 points and earn the 35-point bonus.

**Go Big or Go Safe:** When the stakes are high, take risks on categories like Yahtzee or Large Straight. But if you’re close to a guaranteed score in the upper section, play it safe.

**Hold on to Fours, Fives, and Sixes:** These numbers offer the most points in the upper section, so try to keep them for higher rolls.

### **How do I score a Full House in Yahtzee?**

A Full House in Yahtzee consists of three of one number and two of another (e.g., three 3s and two 6s). This combination always scores 25 points. Even if you roll higher or lower numbers, the points for a Full House are always the same.

### Can I play multiple Yahtzees in a single game?

Yes! After scoring your first Yahtzee, each additional Yahtzee during the game gives you a 100-point bonus, as long as the Yahtzee category is already filled with 50 points. You also get to mark one of the remaining categories with the Yahtzee combination (e.g., use it for Three of a Kind or Full House if available).

### What is the Upper Section bonus and how do I get it?

The Upper Section bonus is worth 35 points and is awarded if the total score of the upper section (Ones through Sixes) is 63 points or higher. This is equivalent to rolling three of each number (e.g., three 1s, three 2s, three 3s, etc.). It’s a critical part of winning the game, so prioritize filling in the upper section early!

### How do Joker rules work in Yahtzee?

The Joker rule applies when you roll a Yahtzee but have already filled in the Yahtzee category with 50 points. If the number matches a still-open upper section category, you must score it there. If the upper section is already filled, you can use the roll to score in any lower section category except for Full House, Small Straight, and Large Straight, which must be scored according to their normal rules.

## The History of Yahtzee

Yahtzee, one of the most iconic and beloved dice games worldwide, has an interesting history that dates back to the mid-20th century. Let’s explore how this classic game originated, evolved, and became a staple in households and game nights around the globe.

#### **The Origins of Yahtzee**

Yahtzee was invented in 1954 by a Canadian couple who loved playing dice games on their yacht. Originally, they referred to it as ”The Yacht Game.” The game became a favorite pastime for them and their friends while sailing, and it wasn’t long before they sought to share their unique dice game with others.

In 1956, the couple approached a toy and game entrepreneur named Edwin S. Lowe. Lowe is credited with popularizing another famous game, Bingo, in the 1920s, and he immediately saw the potential in this new dice game. The couple didn’t want to mass-produce the game for profit, so they made a deal with Lowe: he could have the rights to the game if he provided them with 1,000 copies to give to their friends.

Lowe renamed the game Yahtzee and began marketing it to a wider audience.

#### **The Rise in Popularity**

At first, Yahtzee didn’t take off as quickly as Lowe had hoped. But Lowe believed in the game’s potential and began organizing Yahtzee parties to introduce people to the gameplay. This strategy worked, and once people had a chance to play, they were hooked! The simplicity of the game, combined with its strategic elements, made it a hit among players of all ages.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Yahtzee sales skyrocketed, and it became a household name. By the time Lowe sold his game company in the 1970s, Yahtzee had sold millions of copies.

#### **Yahtzee Today**

Today, Yahtzee is owned by Hasbro, one of the largest toy and game companies in the world. It has become one of the most successful dice games of all time, with more than 50 million games sold annually.

Yahtzee has also been adapted into digital formats, with mobile apps and online versions, allowing players to enjoy the game anytime, anywhere. Several variations of the game have been introduced over the years, including Yahtzee Free For All, Triple Yahtzee, and Yahtzee with Buddies, but the original game remains the most popular.

#### **Why Yahtzee Endures**

The enduring popularity of Yahtzee can be attributed to its perfect balance of luck and strategy. While rolling five of the same number (the coveted Yahtzee) requires a lot of luck, players can use strategy and probability to make smart rerolling decisions and maximize their scores. This mix keeps the game exciting and unpredictable, ensuring that no two games are ever the same.

From its humble beginnings as a yacht-based pastime to its global fame as a classic dice game, Yahtzee’s history is a testament to its universal appeal. Whether you’re playing solo or competing with friends, the thrill of rolling for a Yahtzee remains timeless.
