> **Note on Yatzy vs. Yahtzee:** This guide is based on the classic **Yatzy** rules, common in Scandinavia and Europe (often associated with Alga). These rules differ from the North American **Yahtzee** (Hasbro) version. We cover the Yahtzee-specific rules in a separate section at the end.

### Quick Facts (Yatzy)

* **Players:** 1+
* **Playtime:** 20–30 min
* **Equipment:** 5 dice, scorecard, pen (dice cup optional)
* **Goal:** Get 63+ points in the Upper Section for the bonus (**50 points**) and maximize points in the Lower Section.

Yatzy is one of those games that follows you through life. It's played on summer vacation, on long trips, at the kitchen table on a regular Tuesday, and during late nights when no one really wants to go to bed.

This guide covers how Yatzy works, how the points are counted, and strategies that can help you walk away victorious.

My name is Fredrik, and I work as a journalist by day, but I've dedicated a large part of my life to board games, not least Yatzy! My goal is to provide a complete guide to the game so that a beginner, after reading through this page, can win their first game of Yatzy and impress friends and family!

## 1. Introduction to Yatzy

### What is Yatzy?

Yatzy is a dice game that has been around since the 1950s. This is largely due to the game's simple foundation: you roll dice, save the ones that help you, and try to find combinations that yield high scores.

It's equal parts luck and strategy, but I can promise you that the person who plans smart beats the person who plays planlessly, I can promise you that. Further down the page, you'll find rules of thumb and strategies that I use when I play.

### Object of the Game

Roll dice for scoring combinations, and get the highest total score.

### Equipment and Scorecard

To play Yatzy, you need minimal equipment:

* Five dice
* A pen or pencil
* A scorecard for each player
* A dice cup (optional)

One player is typically designated as the scorekeeper.

## 2. Gameplay: Step-by-Step

### Preparations

Before the fun begins, make sure everyone is set up:

* **Players:** Yatzy can be played by 1 or more players.
* **Equipment:** Distribute a scorecard and pen to each player.
* **First Player:** To decide who goes first, each player in turn rolls all 5 dice. The player with the highest total goes first. Play then passes to the left.

### The Three Rolls

On each turn, players roll the dice up to **three times** to get the best possible combination.

1.  **First Roll:** Roll all five dice.
2.  **Reroll:** After the first roll, you can choose to reroll **any or all** of the dice up to two more times. Keep the dice you like (your "keepers") and reroll the others to improve your chances.
3.  **Final Roll:** After the third roll, or if you’re satisfied earlier, you must use the current dice combination to fill in a category on your scorecard.

*Example: On your first roll, you get two 6s, one 3, one 1, and one 4. You decide to keep the 6s and reroll the other three dice.*

![First roll - decide which dice to keep](/images/Forsta-kastet.webp)

*First roll - this is where you decide which dice to save.*

![Second roll - re-roll the dice you didn't save](/images/Andra-kastet.webp)

*Second roll - re-roll the dice you didn't save.*

![Third roll - your last chance for the combination](/images/Tredje-kastet.webp)

*Third roll - your last chance to get the desired combination.*

### The Art of Saving Dice

Saving dice is about building a combination. You don’t need to declare which combination you’re rolling for; you may change your mind after any roll. You can even reroll "keepers" from a previous roll if you change your strategy.

### Scoring: The Mandatory Choice

Each turn, you **must** choose one of the 15 categories from the scorecard to record your score.

* Each category can only be used **once** per game.
* You must fill in a box on each turn, even if you don't qualify for a combination.

### Striking (Zeroing) a Box

If your rolls don’t match any of your available categories, or if the score would be very low, you must enter a **zero** in one of the categories. Choose wisely—try to zero out a category that you think will be hard to score later, like Yatzy or Large Straight.

## 3. The Scorecard: Heart of Yatzy

![Yatzy Scorecard](/images/Yatzy-protokollet.webp)

*The Yatzy scorecard is divided into an Upper and Lower Section.*

### Overview: Upper and Lower Sections

| Section | Content | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Upper Section** | Aces, Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives, Sixes | Aim for at least 63 points for the bonus |
| **Lower Section** | Pairs, Straights, Full House, Chance, Yatzy | Maximize the value in each category |

### The Upper Section

![The Upper Section: Aces to Sixes - this is where you earn the bonus.](/images/den-ovre-delen-av-yatzy-protokollet.webp)

*The Upper Section: Aces to Sixes - this is where you earn the bonus.*

To score in the Upper Section, add only the dice with the same number and enter the total in the appropriate box.

| Upper Section | What to Score |
| :--- | :--- |
| Aces (Ones) | Total of Aces only |
| Twos | Total of Twos only |
| Threes | Total of Threes only |
| Fours | Total of Fours only |
| Fives | Total of Fives only |
| Sixes | Total of Sixes only |

For example, with the dice **[⚂ ⚂ ⚂ ⚁ ⚃]**, you could score:
* 9 in the **Threes** box (3+3+3)
* 2 in the **Twos** box
* 4 in the **Fours** box

### The Bonus: The Magic Number 63

Your goal in the Upper Section is to score a total of at least **63 points**, to earn a **50-point bonus**.

The 63 points are based on scoring three of each number (Aces through Sixes); however, you may earn the bonus with any combination of scores totaling 63 points or more.

### The Lower Section

![The Lower Section: Here you score combinations.](/images/Nedre-delen-av-protokollet.webp)

*The Lower Section: Here you collect points through different combinations.*

Each of the Lower Section scoring combinations is explained in detail below.

**One Pair:** Score in this box only if the dice include two of the same number. **Score the total of the two dice.**
* *Example:* **[⚄ ⚄ ⚂ ⚁ ⚀]** scores 5+5 = **10 points**.

**Two Pair:** Score in this box only if the dice include two dice of one number and two dice of another. **Score the total of these four dice.** The two pairs must be different.
* *Example:* **[⚃ ⚃ ⚁ ⚁ ⚅]** scores 4+4+2+2 = **12 points**.

![Example of One Pair and Two Pair](/images/Par-och-Tva-par.webp)

**3 of a Kind:** Score in this box only if the dice include 3 or more of the same number. **Score the total of the three dice.**
* *Example:* **[⚄ ⚄ ⚄ ⚁ ⚀]** scores 5+5+5 = **15 points**.

![Example of 3 of a Kind](/images/Tretal.webp)

**4 of a Kind:** Score in this box only if the dice include 4 or more of the same number. **Score the total of the four dice.**
* *Example:* **[⚁ ⚁ ⚁ ⚁ ⚅]** scores 2+2+2+2 = **8 points**.

![Example of 4 of a Kind](/images/Fyrtal.webp)

**Small Straight:** Score in this box only if the dice show the sequence 1-2-3-4-5. Scores **15 points**.

**Large Straight:** Score in this box only if the dice show the sequence 2-3-4-5-6. Scores **20 points**.

**Full House:** Score in this box only if the dice show three of one number and two of another. **Score the total of all 5 dice.**
* *Example:* **[⚁ ⚁ ⚁ ⚂ ⚂]** scores 2+2+2+3+3 = **12 points**.

![Example of a Full House](/images/Kak.webp)

**YATZY:** Score in this box only if the dice show five of the same number (5 of a kind). A YATZY is worth **50 points**.

**Chance:** Score the **total of any 5 dice** in this box. This catch-all category comes in handy when you can’t (or don’t want to) score in another category.
* *Example:* **[⚂ ⚂ ⚅ ⚅ ⚅]** scores 3+3+6+6+6 = **24 points**.

![Example of Chance - sum of all dice](/images/Chans.webp)

## 4. End of Game and Winner

### When the Game is Over

The game ends after all players have filled in their entire scorecard, which happens after **fifteen rounds**.

### Score Counting

Once each player has filled in all 15 category boxes, the game ends. Each player now adds up their score as follows:

1.  **Upper Section:** Add up the Upper Section scores (Aces to Sixes) and enter the total.
2.  **Bonus:** If the Upper Section total is 63 points or more, add the **50-point bonus**.
3.  **Lower Section:** Add up the Lower Section scores (One Pair to Chance).
4.  **Grand Total:** Add the Upper Section total, Bonus, and Lower Section total. This is your final score.

![Adding up the score: Upper Section + Bonus + Lower Section = Grand Total](/images/Rakna-ihop-poangen.webp)

### Winner

After the scores are tallied, the player with the highest **Grand Total** wins the game!

## 5. Strategies for Beginners and Experts

To maximize your score, you need more than luck. Follow these tips for smart rerolling decisions:

#### **Tip 1: Prioritize the Upper Section Early**

In the early rounds, aim to fill in your **Upper Section**. Scoring an average of three of each number (especially Fours, Fives, and Sixes) ensures you get the 50-point bonus. This can make a significant difference.

#### **Tip 2: Strategic Rerolling for Lower Section**

* **Full House:** Since this scores the *total of all dice*, a Full House with high numbers (e.g., 6-6-6-5-5 = 28 points) is much better than one with low numbers (e.g., 2-2-2-1-1 = 8 points).
* **Straights:** The straights (1-2-3-4-5 or 2-3-4-5-6) are hard to get because they require all 5 dice. Don't be afraid to "strike" (zero out) one of them, especially Small Straight, if a better roll is available.
* **Pairs:** Always score the highest pair possible. A pair of 6s (12 pts) is much better than a pair of 2s (4 pts).

#### **Tip 3: Don’t Be Afraid to Use the Chance Category**

If your rolls don’t match any good categories, use the **Chance** category. It’s better to score something than nothing! Try to get at least 20-25 points in this box.

#### **Tip 4: Strike Smart**

If you have to take a zero, be strategic. "Aces" is often the best box to sacrifice early, as the maximum score is only 5. Sacrificing a high-potential box like "4 of a Kind" or "Yatzy" can cost you the game.

## 6. Yatzy Variations

Here are the most common Yatzy variations.

### Maxi Yatzy

Maxi Yatzy is an extended version played with **six dice** and a scorecard with more combinations.

* You roll 6 dice instead of 5.
* The bonus for the Upper Section is 100 points for reaching 84 points.
* New combinations are added, such as:
    * **Three Pair** (e.g., 2-2, 4-4, 5-5)
    * **Full Straight** (1-2-3-4-5-6), worth 21 or 25 points.
    * **House** (two 3-of-a-kinds)
    * **Tower** (a 4-of-a-kind and a pair)
    * **Maxi Yatzy** (all six dice the same), worth 100 points.

### Forced Yatzy (Tvångs-Yatzy)

The rules are identical to classic Yatzy, but with one major twist: you **must** fill the scorecard in order, from top to bottom. You start with "Aces," then "Twos," and so on. You cannot skip. This removes a lot of strategy and adds a lot of luck and frustration!

## 7. Yahtzee Rules: The North American Version

While this site is focused on Yatzy, many visitors look for the rules to the popular North American version, **Yahtzee**, as well. The gameplay is similar (roll 5 dice, 3 rolls per turn), but the scoring is significantly different.

### Yahtzee Upper Section Scoring

This section is identical to Yatzy, but the bonus is smaller.

* **Aces to Sixes:** Score the total of matching dice (e.g., three 5s = 15 points in the "Fives" box).
* **Bonus:** If your total for the Upper Section is **63 points or more**, you get a **35-point bonus**.

### Yahtzee Lower Section Scoring

This is where the main differences are. The Yahtzee scorecard only has 13 boxes in total.

* **3 of a Kind:** You must have at least three identical dice. You score the **total of all 5 dice**.
    * *Example:* **[⚄ ⚄ ⚄ ⚁ ⚀]** scores 5+5+5+2+1 = **18 points**.
* **4 of a Kind:** You must have at least four identical dice. You score the **total of all 5 dice**.
    * *Example:* **[⚁ ⚁ ⚁ ⚁ ⚅]** scores 2+2+2+2+6 = **14 points**.
* **Full House:** You must have three of one number and two of another. A Full House always scores a flat **25 points**.
    * *Example:* **[⚂ ⚂ ⚂ ⚄ ⚄]** scores 25 points.
* **Small Straight:** You must have four dice in a sequence (e.g., 1-2-3-4, 2-3-4-5, or 3-4-5-6). A Small Straight always scores a flat **30 points**.
* **Large Straight:** You must have five dice in a sequence (1-2-3-4-5 or 2-3-4-5-6). A Large Straight always scores a flat **40 points**.
* **YAHTZEE:** Five dice of the same number. This scores **50 points**.
* **Chance:** Any combination. You score the **total of all 5 dice**.

### Yahtzee Bonus & Joker Rules

This is a key feature of the Hasbro game.

* **First Yahtzee:** You score 50 points in the YAHTZEE box.
* **Subsequent Yahtzees:** If you roll another Yahtzee after having already scored 50 in the box, you get a **100-point bonus**!
* **Joker Rules:** After scoring your 100-point bonus, you must fill another box on your scorecard with that roll.
    1.  You **must** score in the appropriate Upper Section box if it is open (e.g., five 4s must be scored as 20 in the Fours box).
    2.  If the appropriate Upper Section box is *also* filled, you may score in any open Lower Section box. Your roll (e.g., five 4s) counts as a valid "Full House" (25 pts), "Small Straight" (30 pts), or "Large Straight" (40 pts).
    3.  If all other eligible boxes are filled, you must enter a zero in any open Upper Section box.
